**Homework #4** -  Web APIs: Code Quiz

*Description*
  For this week's homework assignment, the task was to create a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by Javascript code in addition to have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.


*Rationale*
  At some point in the journey to become a full-stack web developer, it will be likely to be asked to complete a coding assessmentâ€”perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.


*Objectives*
* Create a timed quiz that can store high scores using Javascript fundamentals
* When the start button is clicked, a timer starts and am presented with the first question
* When a question is answered, the user is presented with a new question
* If the question is answered incorrectly, time will be subtracted from the timer
* When all questions are answered OR the timer reaches 0, the game is over
* Once the game is over, the user can save their initials and score before resetting and starting over
* Game can store high scores so that progress can be compared
